The game writes a single save file to "Systemdata.rxdata" in the game folder.
You should be making backups of this file because it can be corrupted if there is a power outage while saving.

Further in the guide x..y is a random number from x to y, for example 1..100 is a random number from 1 to 100.



Characters

Character level allows to pick skills. PT determines how many skills can be active at once.
Black and green skills must be activated to take effect, red and yellow don't.
Max character level is 5. PT level is unlimited.
Character experience required: 5k, 20k, 100k, 400k, 1000k.
PT experience required: 20k, 60k, 180k, 540k, 1000k.
Experience gained equals to peak distance reached during the flight.
If a skill is carried over through loop, that skill doesn't cost a level, so the character will be able to get 6 skills.



Items

At every direction there are 5 distance ranges where an item can spawn.
When starting a flight, an item is randomly generated at each distance range.
The list of possible items is predetermined for each distance range.
"Item Radar" allows to see the nearest item.
Blueprint spawn formulas look like this
  spawn a blueprint if
  1..100 - blueprint_specific - Recipe_UP_bonus < 10
  blueprint_specific is a number from 10 to 35 specific to each blueprint
  if Apricot's "Recipe UP" is active, Recipe_UP_bonus is a number from 25 to 40 specific to each blueprint

When reaching an item, there is a separate chance to grab it.
The item is grabbed if
  1..100 - Material_UP_bonus < item_specific_chance
  Camellia's "Material UP"
  1 +5..15
  2 +10..25
  3 +20..35
  "Material UP" is not useful at story 9 because all items there have a high chance to be grabbed
  item_specific_chance is around 50 for low tier blueprints, around 30 for high tier blueprints

Woods spawn at lower-left and upper-right.
Stones at upper-left and lower-right.
Metals are everywhere.
Rare metals and jewelry have a 10% chance to spawn at any range.
The easiest way to get resources is to stack daily passive income skills:
  "Standby Item Rank UP", "Standby Material UP", "Rare Metal UP" and "Jewelry UP".

  overweight_penalty
    1 if 0 < overweight < 100
    overweight/100 if overweight > 100
    If Apricot's "Weight Relief" is active, overweight_penalty is divided by 2
    When dividing, all numbers are rounded toward zero
    For example with weight 390 and "Weight Relief", there is 190 overweight
      190/100 = 1.9, rounded to zero results in 1 base overweight penalty
      applying "Weight Relief" 1/2 = 0.5, rounded to zero results in 0 total overweight penalty

Meters breaking

"Fuel Gauge", "Range Finder", "Speedometer" and "Item Radar" may break at all lower directions.
Each "tick", break one of those 4 modules selected randomly if
  0..25000 < meter_break_chance
  meter_break_chance is initially 0
  If a meter was broken, meter_break_chance is divided by 2
  If a meter wasn't broken, meter_break_chance is increased by 1
    If Camellia's "Meter Check" is active, that increase won't happen with a 50% chance
If Camellia's "45 Degree Chop" is active, each "tick", go into "repair mode" if
  0..100 == 0
  When in "repair mode", each "tick", repair a meter of meter_id if
    0..100 == meter_id
    meter_id is a number from 0 to 3
    If a meter is successfully repaired, go out of "repair mode" and divide meter_break_chance by 3



Enemies

Damage from enemies does not affect max weight and fuel.
Enemies always break lower level modules first.
If all damageable modules are broken, the next successful enemy attack destroys the plane.

Each "tick", encounter a random available enemy if
  0..30000 + Encounter_Reduction_bonus < encounter_chance
  if Lacquer's "Encounter Reduction" is active, Encounter_Reduction_bonus is 0..5000
  encounter_chance is initially 0, increased by 1..3 each "tick" and set to 0 after an encounter

Enemy successfully hits if
  1..100 + Evasion_UP_bonus < enemy_accuracy
  Lacquer's "Evasion UP" bonus
  1 +5..10
  2 +10..20
  3 +15..30

When using Lacquer's "Flee", escape if
  1..100 - Super_Escape_bonus < 25
  if "Super Escape" is active, Super_Escape_bonus is 25..35
Can't escape from the boss.

Camellia's "Hindenburg" provides guaranteed escape but completely sacrifices a module, so it must be crafted again.
Can't escape from the boss.

Tori Bird appears at all upper directions.
Other enemies only at upper-left and upper-right.

Tori Bird
accuracy: 30
HP: 1..2

Story progress

Loop points
1 died in story 1
3 died in story 2
5 did one of the 2-5 endings
7 died in story 3
10 died with Endless Chrono

At first can fly only to lower-left and lower-right.
At day 11 flying down is unlocked.
At day 23 flying up is unlocked.
Fly up, reach at least 14k and run out of fuel to get story 2.

Endings
2. Kill the boss at upper-left or upper-right.
3. In story 2 fly up, reach at least 400k and run out of fuel.
4. Reach day 180 OR pass 150 days since reaching story 2.
5. Fly down, find "end fragment" and bring it back to base.
     Appears at distance 350k..450k, weight 300.

If did all endings 2-5 in previous loops, flying up will activate story 3:
  no enemies, meters don't break, the only available ending is dying out of fuel.

Final endings.
In story 1 before day 6, fly left, right or down, reach at least 2000k and run out of fuel. Activates story 9.
If did any of 2-5 ending in previous loops, get Clover path.
Else get the boring version of story 9.

Story 9 Clover path
Final flight
1. Reach 1000k to encounter the boss.
2. Deal at least 9 damage in one combat turn and have 10 damageable modules to survive and get full repair.
3. Reach at least 2000k and run out of fuel to get a refuel.
4. Reach at least 3500k and have less than 200 fuel
     to get all modules, max weight increase, and *17 boost to max speed and acceleration.
5. Reach at least 20000k and run out fuel to get the ending.
Launching the game after completing the Clover path gives an extra dialog.

Story 9 boring path
How to reach 2000k in 6 days with just 3 loop points without 2-5 endings.
  In loop menu select engine 3, body 3, fuel 4.
  Equip engine 3, fuel 4, "Range Meter".
  Fly left or right, start to return at distance 60k, give all EXP to Camellia.
  At day 2 Camellia must reach level 3.
  Learn and activate "Weight Control", equip "Fuel Gauge" and "Speedometer".
  Fly left or right, start to return at distance 120k, give all EXP to Camellia.
  At day 5 Camellia must reach level 4.
  Learn and activate "Zeppelin", equip body 3, unequip all meters.
  Fly down. You should reach 2000k and get the boring version of story 9.
Final flight
Reach at least 7500k and run out fuel to get the ending.
There is an extra text in Results.txt file after completing the boring version.



Additional files

In the GitHub repository of this guide there are cheat versions of "CommonEvents.rxdata".
Sets base max speed and base acceleration to 100k.
After getting hit by the enemy,
  sets base max speed and base acceleration to 3k so Clover path final flight wouldn't be completely broken.
EXP is assigned in chunks of 333333.
Going to the next loop gives 99 of each resource.
Saves should be compatible between cheat and non-cheat versions.
In story 1, it's easy to accidentally activate story 9 by flying left, right or down till out of fuel.

In the GitHub repository of this guide there is "SCE_scripts.txt" which lists notable game scripts.
